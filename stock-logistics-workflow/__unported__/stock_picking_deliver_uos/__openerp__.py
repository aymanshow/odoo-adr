    Stock Partial Picking wizard allowing the user to use the uos quantity
    (instead of the standard uom) to specify the quantity to be delivered.
    For example if i have to deliver 3 tables (uos qty=3 uos=pz)
    each one of 1,5 m² (uom=m², line uom qty=4,5),
    I can make a partial delivery specifying 2 pieces
    (the system computes the internal uom qty:  3 m²)""",
