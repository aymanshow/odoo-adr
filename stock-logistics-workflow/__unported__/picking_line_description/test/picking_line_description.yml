    In order to test picking_line_description,
    I assign group_use_product_description_per_picking_line group to the admin user
-
    !record {model: res.users, id: base.user_root}:
        groups_id:
        - picking_line_description.group_use_product_description_per_picking_line
-
    I set the description field on the product 'USB Adapter'
-
    !record {model: product.product, id: product.product_product_48}:
        description: 'Wi-Fi Adapter'
-
    Now i create an outgoing picking order that uses my product
-
    !record {model: stock.picking, id: stock_picking_out0}:
        partner_id: base.res_partner_2
        move_lines:
            - product_id: product.product_product_48
              product_qty: 10
-
    I verify that the onchange of product on move line was correctly triggered
-
    !assert {model: stock.picking, id: stock_picking_out0, string: The onchange function of product was not correctly triggered}:
        - move_lines[0].name == move_lines[0].product_id.description
        - move_lines[0].name == u'Wi-Fi Adapter'
