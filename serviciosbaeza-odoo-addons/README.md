Serv. Tecnol. Baeza - Odoo addons
=================================

This repository hosts modules developed by Servicios Tecnol√≥gicos Avanzados - 
Pedro M. Baeza that doesn't fit in any OCA (Odoo Community Association) 
repository due to its specificity or because it can not be integrated yet.

You can find lots of modules developed by us in OCA repositories, together with
a lot of other modules developed by the rest of the community. Check the list
here: https://github.com/OCA.
